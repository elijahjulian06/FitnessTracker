Fitness tracker that focuses on creating data analyis through csv files. I used multiple patterns to help set up a future framework for more data analysis on different workout metrics. I also made a demo app to show off the visitor pattern. And print each workout.

How to use:

1. git clone https://github.com/AppState-TopicsInSoftwareEngineering/final-project-elijahjulian06/blob/main/app/src/main/resources/test.csv 

2. Create a csv any where on your computer.
   1. Insert top row with data -> Date, WorkoutName, Number of total sets, Number of Reps, Rpe, x amount of sets
   2. if you dont wanna create your own. I have a demo csv file under the resources directory.

3. Copy entire file path or relative (entire is easier) 

4. gradle build

5. gradle run
future:

implement more robust visitor classes. build better front end. not just a demo app. clean up csvreadwriter
